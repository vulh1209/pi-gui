# Repo Guidelines

These rules apply for the full session.

## Workflow
- Define success criteria before coding; if unclear, stop and clarify.
- For non-trivial work, plan verification up front with the `self-test` skill.
- Do not create or switch to new branches to start work unless the user explicitly asks; respect the current branch or worktree as intentional.
- Commit in small focused checkpoints; don’t batch unrelated changes.
- Run `simplify` before closing non-trivial implementation work.

## Product
- This repo is building a Codex-style desktop app for `pi`; preserve that product direction.
- Desktop work is not done until it is verified on the real Electron surface, not only by unit tests.
- Transcript/timeline behavior, session correctness, and Codex-style UX are product features, not polish.
- Prefer clean reimplementation over patching around local complexity.

## Safety
- Never delete user session history, cached transcripts, screenshots, or temp artifacts without approval.
- Treat files you didn’t edit as read-only when multiple agents may be working.
- Ask before destructive commands or history rewrites.

## Structure
- Prefer path-scoped guidance in nested `AGENTS.md` files over growing this file.
- Keep the desktop renderer/main/preload boundary tight; avoid broad Node exposure to the renderer.
- Keep `pi-sdk-driver` thin over `pi-mono`; don’t fork or reimplement `pi` runtime behavior unless necessary.

## Source Of Truth
- Root `AGENTS.md` is the repo instruction source of truth.
- Root `CLAUDE.md` should remain a symlink to `AGENTS.md`.

## Guidelines
Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes. Merge with project-specific instructions as needed.

**Tradeoff:** These guidelines bias toward caution over speed. For trivial tasks, use judgment.

## 1. Think Before Coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:
- State your assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them - don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

## 2. Simplicity First

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

## 3. Surgical Changes

**Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.**

When editing existing code:
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it - don't delete it.

When your changes create orphans:
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused.
- Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.

The test: Every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

## 4. Goal-Driven Execution

**Define success criteria. Loop until verified.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals:
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"

For multi-step tasks, state a brief plan:
```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

---

**These guidelines are working if:** fewer unnecessary changes in diffs, fewer rewrites due to overcomplication, and clarifying questions come before implementation rather than after mistakes.
