# pi-gui

Experimental Electron desktop shell for `pi` sessions.

This repo packages a desktop UI around `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`. It is not a standalone coding agent runtime. The app depends on the upstream `pi` package for session management, model/auth setup, and agent execution.

## Status

- Experimental
- macOS-first desktop app
- Public source repo, not currently configured for npm publication

## What It Does

- Opens local workspaces in a desktop shell
- Lists and resumes `pi` sessions associated with each workspace
- Creates new sessions and sends prompts through the `pi` runtime
- Persists desktop UI state such as selected workspace, selected session, and composer draft

## Prerequisites

- Node.js
- `pnpm`
- A working `pi` runtime environment through `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`
- Valid model/provider authentication supported by `pi`

Because this app wraps `pi`, you will need whatever auth and local setup `pi` itself requires before live agent runs will work.

## Development

Install dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

Run the desktop app in development:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Build everything:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Run the default test suite:

```bash
pnpm test
```

Regenerate the README demo assets:

```bash
pnpm --filter @pi-gui/desktop demo:readme
```

## Repository Layout

- `apps/desktop`: Electron app and renderer UI
- `packages/session-driver`: shared session driver types
- `packages/catalogs`: lightweight workspace/session catalog state
- `packages/pi-sdk-driver`: adapter from the desktop app to `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent`

## Known Limitations

- The app currently relies on upstream `pi` behavior and local auth state.
- Live end-to-end validation may require model credentials not stored in this repo.
- Package manifests remain `private: true`; this repo is intended for source collaboration first.

## Acknowledgements
